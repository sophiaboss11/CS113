
Self-check #1
–Determine how many times the output statement is displayed in each of the following fragments.  Indicate whether the algorithm is O(n) or O(n^2)

a)for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
   for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
  System.out.println(i + “ “ + j);
  }
}


		The algorithm is O(n^2)
		The output is displayed n * n times.
