Provide a driver menu program that builds the MorseCodeTree and asks the user if they want to
1) test output for all morse code letters with their respective translated alphabet
letters (make sure you are using the MorseCodeTree to do the actual translation,
 output as a nicely formatted table. Doesn't have to be alphabetized but that would be
  nice for the user ðŸ˜ƒ),
  2) enter an input textfile name with morse code to decode and output
   the translated text to the console, and
   3) enter in a line of morse code through the console
   to decode morse code and output the translated text to the console.
